# Set Up:
    # In Terminal, `cd` into `server` and run the following:
        # export FLASK_APP=app.py
        # export FLASK_RUN_PORT=5000
        # flask db init
        # flask db revision --autogenerate -m 'Create tables' 
        # flask db upgrade 
        # python seed.py

from flask import Flask, request, make_response, jsonify
from flask_migrate import Migrate

# 1. ‚úÖ Import `Api` and `Resource` from `flask_restful`
    # ‚ùì What do these two classes do at a higher level? 

from models import db, Production, CrewMember

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///app.db'
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS'] = False
# Note: `app.json.compact = False` configures JSON responses to print on indented lines
app.json.compact = False

migrate = Migrate(app, db)
db.init_app(app)

# 2. ‚úÖ Initialize the Api
    # `api = Api(app)`

# 3. ‚úÖ Create a Production class that inherits from Resource

# 4. ‚úÖ Create a GET (All) Route
    # 4.1 Make a `get` method that takes `self` as a param.
    # 4.2 Create a `productions` array.
    # 4.3 Make a query for all productions. For each `production`, create a dictionary 
    # containing all attributes before appending to the `productions` array.
    # 4.4 Create a `response` variable and set it to: 
    #  #make_response(
    #       jsonify(productions),
    #       200
    #  )
    # 4.5 Return `response`.
    # 4.6 After building the route, run the server and test in the browser.
  
# 5. ‚úÖ Serialization
    # This is great, but there's a cleaner way to do this! Serialization will allow us to easily add our 
    # associations as well.
    # Navigate to `models.py` for Steps 6 - 9.

# 10. ‚úÖ Use our serializer to format our response to be cleaner
    # 10.1 Query all of the productions, convert them to a dictionary with `to_dict` before setting them to a list.
    # 10.2 Invoke `make_response`, pass it the production list along with a status of 200. Set `make_response` to a 
    # `response` variable.
    # 10.3 Return the `response` variable.
    # 10.4 After building the route, run the server and test your results in the browser.
 
# 11. ‚úÖ Create a POST Route
    # Prepare a POST request in Postman. Under the `Body` tab, select `form-data` and fill out the body 
    # of a production request. 
    
    # Create the POST route 
    # üìö Review With Students: request object
    
    # 11.1 Create a `post` method and pass it `self`.
    # 11.2 Create a new production from the `request.form` object.
    # 11.3 Add and commit the new production.
    # 11.4 Convert the new production to a dictionary with `to_dict`
    # 11.5 Set `make_response` to a `response` variable and pass it the new production along with a status of 201.
    # 11.6 Test the route in Postman.

   
# 12. ‚úÖ Add the new route to our api with `api.add_resource`

# 13. ‚úÖ Create a GET (One) route
    # 13.1 Build a class called `ProductionByID` that inherits from `Resource`.
    # 13.2 Create a `get` method and pass it the id along with `self`. (This is how we will gain access to 
    # the id from our request)
    # 13.3 Make a query for our production by the `id` and build a `response` to send to the browser.


# 14. ‚úÖ Add the new route to our api with `api.add_resource`
